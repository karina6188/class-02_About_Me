    <h2 id="story">My Stories</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I was born and raised in Taiwan then moved to Seattle ten years ago. I grew up in a loving family with two sisters. After finishing high school, I came to Seattle for college following my older sister's footsteps. It was difficult at first since English was my second language. What was even harder was to attend college with a second language that I did not know much about! However I never gave up but work even harder to improve my English and completed all the courses. In 2014, I was proud to invite my parents and relatives to my graduation ceremony as I earned my bachelor degree from University of Washington.</p>
